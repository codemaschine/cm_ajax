Inserting images
----------------

When you insert images you can either:

|image-2| Make a copy/paste from eg. Photoshop, but it's **REALLY IMPORTANT**  that you insert the
image into Open Office by the menu “Edit > Paste Special” and then select “Bitmap”. If you
don't do it in this way the image cannot be shown (since it will not be stored as a PNG internally
in the SXW file)
Alternatively you can use the traditional way “**Insert > Graphics > From file** ” and insert
an image from your harddrive. In particular use this if the image is photographic (JPG) since the
internal storage as PNG is not good for photographs.

.. |image-2| image:: ../../Images/image-2.png

Generally please use copy/paste only for screendumps with large areas of similar color (good
png-compression) and JPG-files for photographic images. Go for small images, 72 dpi, medium quality.
