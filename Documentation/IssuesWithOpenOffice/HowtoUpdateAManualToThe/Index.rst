HowTo: Update a manual to the new layout
----------------------------------------

With these steps you get it very fast

Update the extension doc_template (maybe a new one is out)
Hit the F11 key to show the styles
>> Copy everything from your old manual except the title page and the table of contents <<
Delete contents from new manual but leave the title page and the table of contents there 
Paste your content and check that formatting is correct and images are in place 
Hint: When the header-styles are still in the old layout then **clear**  and **re-assign**  the
new style
Update the page properties with your extension key, e-mail-address, name, language, tagging. In
the moment the language- and tagging-properties are not in use by the TER, but findable by search.
Reload the table of content (right click update index table) 
Insert your extension key below the document title 

Ready.
